Option Market Data
==================

The Historical Option Trading Data provides an in-depth look at 
the options market, capturing data from the most recent trades 
to trades from years past. Derived from leading global exchanges, 
our historical option data provides unparalleled insights 
for option traders, researchers, and analysts. 

About the Data
==============

Options are financial derivatives that provide buyers with the 
right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a 
specified price on or before a particular date. Their complex 
nature demands richer datasets to ensure informed trading 
and research. Beyond the basic trade and quote data, our 
historical option data includes the Greeks – the various 
factors that influence an option's price – and 
implied volatility, a crucial metric in option pricing.

Trade Data
==========

Our trade data encompasses details of each option transaction. 
This includes the strike price, expiration date, and whether 
the option is a call or put. Each transaction also provides 
insights into the volume, direction of the trade, exact 
timestamp, and the price at which the option was traded.

Quotes and the Bid-Ask Spread
=============================

Quotes are especially critical for options due to their 
intricate pricing model. Our dataset provides the bid 
and ask prices, as well as the volume associated with 
these quotes. By studying the bid-ask spread, traders 
can glean insights into an option's liquidity and 
potential transaction costs.

Greeks and Implied Volatility
=============================

The Greeks play a pivotal role in option pricing 
and risk management. Our data provides:

- **Delta:** Measures the rate of change of the option price concerning a change in the underlying asset price.
- **Gamma:** Represents the rate of change of Delta concerning the underlying asset's price.
- **Theta:** Measures the rate of decline in the option's value due to the passage of time.
- **Vega:** Captures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the underlying asset's volatility.
- **Rho:** Represents the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the risk-free interest rate.

Beyond the Greeks, our dataset offers the Implied Volatility for each option, which is a projection of the option's future volatility and a key ingredient in option pricing models.

Data Integrity and Trust
========================

With the complexity of options, ensuring data accuracy is even more crucial. Our algorithms continuously cross-check data points for inconsistencies, and any irregularities are swiftly corrected.
